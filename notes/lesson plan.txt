Tone and volume.  

These are characteristics of what we aim to produce.  

They are the result of our efforts.  Let's focus on what we control in order to produce tone and volume:  breathing and rhythm.

Rhythm because our entire experience of music is temporal.  

To percieve a sound as tone rather than noise, time needs to pass while the tone sustains.

While playing even a single note, the experience of time passing is essential to how humans comprehend its meaning.  We comprehend things in phrases about the length of a breath, or sentence.  Then we take a breath.


Using a metronome allows us to measure and expereince time.  

It also allows us to measure our progress, in terms of how long we hold a note.  

Volume is also meaningful in terms of contrast.  

Using a metronome allows us to plan and execute attempts to extend and control our volume throughout a phrase.  


At first, we want to produce a characteristic sound, at a satisfying volume.  Then, we want to produce that characteristic sound at different volumes.  

The anatomical things we need to do to support sound at different volumes is somewhat non-intuitive.  Since it easiest to produce sound at a medium volume, and more difficult to produce at both soft and loud volumes.  

So, the amount of effort is not proportional to the volume.  We need to think about, prepare and practice playing at different volumes intentionally.


We don't call them Wind instruments for nothing.  Because we move air through a saxophone to create sound.

Every aspect of this process needs to be understood, coordinated and trained in order to make it work.

It is important to control both the onset of a note as well as its decay.
