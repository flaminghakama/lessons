Preparing for audition for arts school:
* Classical (written) pieces  
* Improv on blues (Au Privave)
* Sight reading

Worked on classical pieces rhythm, articulations, intonation, breathing
Played Au Privave from memory


12/16/18

Warm up on long tones exercise with dynamics (D - A - D - A - D)
Played all major scales
Introduced grand arpeggio and scales in thirds

Introduced and played through pentatonic scale exercises in D minor / F major

Sight read 2 blues in G (Blues Walk) and D (Blues for Duane) and discussed use of blues scale
Improv on D blues scale over D blues

Worked on classical piece, focus on rhythm and breathing
* Knows some sections by ear, and plays them somewhat inaccurately
* Plays well-known passages too quickly

Discussed reed rotation -- always use a different reed each time you play

Discussed saxophone maintenance -- cork on the neck is old and compressed, so mouthpiece doesn't stay in place.  No need to use cork grease every time.  For now, it might help to wipe/scrape some off so it isn't so slippery.   Eventually, the cork will need to be replaced.   Can be temporarily adjusted by wrapping cork with a little plumbers tape.  However, using tape will compress the cork more, which will hasten the point at which recorking needs to happen.



Roate use of your reeds.   Use a different reed each time you play.  Use each of them once before repeating.

Warm up on long tones with dynamics.  When playing loud, go as loud as possible so you learn where the pitch and tone change.  Pay attention to intonation -- try to avoid going flat when getting louder. Play as slow as possible so that you complete the exercise in a full breath.  Make sure to inhale fully before starting.

Practice classical pieces with a metronome--relax and enjoy your tone during the easy passages rather than speeding up.

Practice the pentatonic scale exercises in D minor / F major.  Use a metronome and work up to the target tempo.  Write down the fastest tempo you can play accurately.


Scale and chord exercises for keys helpful for Au Privave.

12/23/18

Played through scales C, G, D, A & F in Major, Natural Minor, Myxolydian (Dominant) and Blues

Gave him printouts for both parallel and relative scales in thirds.  We also talked briefly about the other scales on there: Dorian Minor, Melodic Minor and Harmonic Minor.  Gave him printouts of the scales in thirds exercises.  Next time need printouts of the Grand Arpeggio exercise.

Discussion of approach to improvisation based on blues scale and the blues chord changes (below).

Practiced soloing on concert F blues (Au Privave)

Rehearsed Allegro and Andante pieces.  
Allegro had better dynamics and rhythm was more solid.


To practice:

Major, Dominant, Blues and Natural minor scales for C, F, G, D, A

Scales in thirds exercises, for C, G, F, D, A. 

Find out the fastest tempo you can play each scale without making errors.  Practice the Natural minor rather than what is wiritten, which is Harmonic minor, by ignoring the accidentals.

Print out this exercise, and play

Practice playing your slow classical piece as loud as you can stand, to help develop tone and dynaic range.


To practice for the improvisation, besides playing with the backing track, 
print out and practice these chord exercises for the chords in the blues form:
http://davidelainealt.com/lessons/pdf/chords-for-blues.pdf

	You can always play a blues scale on any chord. 
	So, that is a fine place to start.

	But, in order to express the differences among the parts of the song, start by identifing the notes that change between chords.  

	Incorporate the chord-specific notes, and let them guide your melodic choices, , in addition to (or instead of) notes in the blues scale.


	In particular, there are tendencies for two notes in a Dominant 7 chord:  the 3rd leads up, and the b7th leads down, each to the next chromatic note.  

		From D7 to G7     F# => G
		                  C => B

		From A7 to D7     G => F# (harmonic)
		                  C# => D 

	Since this is overlayed on a blues scale, these notes can also lead back to the blues scale versions, also adjacent chromatic notes. 

	So, we can can also use these note movements:

		From D7 to G7     F# => G (harmonic)
		                  F# => F (blues)
		                  C => B

		From A7 to D7     G => F# (harmonic)
		                  G => F  (blues)
		                  C# => D 
		                  C# => C (blues)

    [ Exerise to map out F/F#/G over the blues form ] 
    [ Exercise to map out B/C/C# over the blues form ] 
    [ Exercise to demonstrate difference between harmonic and blues ] 


	So when you get to the end of the D7 measures and want to say "Here comes the next section of the song", play the note C and emphasize it.

	Start with short patterns from the blues scale and repeat them over each measure  Change notes as the chords change to follow this pattern:
 
 		D7 has F# (3rd) and C (b7).   
		Play F#, instead of the F from the blues scale.
		Try to end the first 4-bar phrase on C (the b7) which wants to lead down to B.  

		G7 has F (b7) and B (3rd).   
		Play B instead of A or C
	 	Go back to playing F instead of F# 
	 	Emphasize G

		A7 has G (b7) and C# (3rd).
		Play C# instead of the C from the blues scale
		Emphasize the G (the b7) which wants to lead down to F#
		(Either F or F# is ok )
