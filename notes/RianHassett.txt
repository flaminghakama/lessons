Preparing for audition for arts school:
* Classical (written) pieces  
* Improv on blues (Au Privave)
* Sight reading

Worked on classical pieces rhythm, articulations, intonation, breathing
Played Au Privave from memory


12/16/18

Warm up on long tones exercise with dynamics (D - A - D - A - D)
Played all major scales
Introduced grand arpeggio and scales in thirds

Introduced and played through pentatonic scale exercises in D minor / F major

Sight read 2 blues in G (Blues Walk) and D (Blues for Duane) and discussed use of blues scale
Improv on D blues scale over D blues

Worked on classical piece, focus on rhythm and breathing
* Knows some sections by ear, and plays them somewhat inaccurately
* Plays well-known passages too quickly

Discussed reed rotation -- always use a different reed each time you play

Discussed saxophone maintenance -- cork on the neck is old and compressed, so mouthpiece doesn't stay in place.  No need to use cork grease every time.  For now, it might help to wipe/scrape some off so it isn't so slippery.   Eventually, the cork will need to be replaced.   Can be temporarily adjusted by wrapping cork with a little plumbers tape.  However, using tape will compress the cork more, which will hasten the point at which recorking needs to happen.



Roate use of your reeds.   Use a different reed each time you play.  Use each of them once before repeating.

Warm up on long tones with dynamics.  When playing loud, go as loud as possible so you learn where the pitch and tone change.  Pay attention to intonation -- try to avoid going flat when getting louder. Play as slow as possible so that you complete the exercise in a full breath.  Make sure to inhale fully before starting.

Practice classical pieces with a metronome--relax and enjoy your tone during the easy passages rather than speeding up.

Practice the pentatonic scale exercises in D minor / F major.  Use a metronome and work up to the target tempo.  Write down the fastest tempo you can play accurately.

We played through scales C, G, D, A & F in Major, Natural Minor, Myxolydian (Dominant) and Blues.

Rian is pretty solid on his major scales and is close to the same on minor.  He needs a moment to figure out the key signature and then 1-2 tries to play the scale correctly.  He should proceed to practice the Scales in Thirds exercises, which will help solidify that. 

I gave him printouts of the these Scales in Thirds exercises, for Major and Minor.  

For the Minor scales in thirds, he should ignore the accidentals.  (The reasoning for the accidentals is explained better on other printouts I gave him, which compare Parallel and Relative scales, and introduce some other scales he hasn't played yet:  Dorian Minor, Melodic Minor and Harmonic Minor.)


It would be ideal if you could print the Grand Arpeggio (or read them online on a tablet), as I was not able to print these out.

http://davidelainealt.com/lessons/pdf/grand-arpeggio.pdf

The Grand Arpeggios will help him a lot on the improvisation front.  For each scale he is learning, he should practice the corresponding Grand Arpeggio.


We discussed an approach to improvisation based on blues scale and the blues chord changes.  More on that below.

We practiced him soloing on concert F blues (Au Privave) with me accompaning on piano.  I was mainly curious about the backing track to see how busy the chord changes are.  

I am introducing him to a more stripped-down blues form with 3 chords (D7, G7, A7), whereas the actual song has 3X that). 

Here is another exercise he should practice to learn these chords in context:
http://davidelainealt.com/lessons/pdf/chords-for-blues.pdf



We rehearsed the Allegro and Andante pieces.  
The Allegro had better dynamics and rhythm was more solid than last time.


Regarding his instrument, I played it and it was generally responsive.  I'd say there was a small amount of leakage on the bottom few notes, but only to the degree that you would have difficulty playing them softly, at normal volumes they are accessible.  

I was using my mouthpiece, and the cork situation seemed fine.   It is possible that Rian's mouthpiece is a bit larger, but more likely that it was just a mattter of more cork grease than necessary.  So, all in all, I didn't see any reason to rush to the repair person.  It could certainly could use some amount of TLC to help with the sealing on the low notes, but nothing major.



To practice:

Major, Dominant, Blues and Natural minor scales for C, F, G, D, A from memory.

Scales in thirds exercises, for C, G, F, D, A. 

Find out the fastest tempo you can play each scale without making errors.  Practice the Natural minor rather than what is wiritten, which is Harmonic minor, by ignoring the accidentals.


Print out this exercise, and play

Practice playing your slow classical piece as loud as you can stand, to help develop tone and dynaic range.


To practice for the improvisation, besides playing with the backing track, 
print out and practice these chord exercises for the chords in the blues form:

Apprach to improvisation on a blues form

	You can always play a blues scale on any chord. 
	So, that is a fine place to start.

	But, in order to express the differences among the parts of the song, start by identifing the notes that change between chords.  

	Incorporate the chord-specific notes, and let them guide your melodic choices, in addition to (or instead of) notes in the blues scale.


	The starting point is the D blues scale (D F G A C D).
	Some notes to alter to fit the chords:

		On D7, play F# instead of F.

		On G7, play B instead of C.

		On A7, play C# instead of C.

	We also talked about "leading tones", which are the notes that 
	point towards the next chord.  By empahsizing these notes, you 
	express the intention of these chords.

	In Dominant 7th chords, these notes are the 3rd, which leads up, 
	and the b7, which leads down. 

	When you get to the end of the D7 measures and want to say 
	"Here comes the next section of the song" play C, the b7,
	and emphasize it.  Then follow it up by paying the notes it likes 
	to lead towards, B in the G7 chord.

	Likewise, on the A7 chord, the G (the b7) leads down to the F# of the D7 chord.
	And it's C# leads up to the root of the D7 chord.


	You can start with short patterns from the blues scale
	Rrepeat them over each measure, but 
	Change the notes as the chords change to follow this pattern:
 
 		D7 play F#, instead of the F from the blues scale.
		Try to end the first 4-bar phrase on C (the b7) which wants to lead down to B.  

		G7 play B instead of A or C from the blues scale
	 	Go back to playing F instead of F# 
	 	Emphasize G

		A7 play C# instead of the C from the blues scale
		Emphasize the G (the b7) which wants to lead down to F#
		(Either F or F# is ok )
	

Here is more of the same theory, expanded a bit.

	In particular, there are tendencies for two notes in a Dominant 7 chord:  the 3rd leads up, and the b7th leads down, each to the next chromatic note.  

		From D7 to G7     F# => G
		                  C => B

		From A7 to D7     G => F# (harmonic)
		                  C# => D 

	Since this is overlayed on a blues scale, these notes can also lead back to the blues scale versions, also adjacent chromatic notes. 

	So, we can can also use these note movements:

		From D7 to G7     F# => G (harmonic)
		                  F# => F (blues)
		                  C => B

		From A7 to D7     G => F# (harmonic)
		                  G => F  (blues)
		                  C# => D 
		                  C# => C (blues)
